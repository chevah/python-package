SQLite code is built by the pysqlite module, thus there's no "chevahbs" script.

This sub-directory holds SQLite, as downloaded from upstream and unpacked.

For example, for version 3.36.0:

 * sources from https://sqlite.org/2021/sqlite-autoconf-3360000.tar.gz
 * 32bit DLL from https://sqlite.org/2021/sqlite-dll-win32-x86-3360000.zip
 * 64bit DLL from https://sqlite.org/2021/sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3360000.zip

Sources sub-dir was renamed from "sqlite-autoconf-3360000" to "SQLite-3.36.0".

DLL files were renamed from "sqlite3.dll" to "sqlite3-3.36.0-x86.dll" and
"sqlite3-3.36.0-x64.dll" respectively.

Windows binaries are used to update the SQLite DLLs bundled with upstream
Python installers on Windows.
