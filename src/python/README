As Python 2.7 is no longer maintained upstream, security patches are lifted from
ActiveState's fork: https://github.com/ActiveState/cpython/commits/2.7.

E.g. to fix CVE-2020-10735 from https://github.com/ActiveState/cpython/pull/18,
use https://github.com/ActiveState/cpython/pull/18.diff to save the patch
to apply to our Python sources tree, then issue something like:

    cd Python-2.7.18
    patch -p1 <~/CVE-2020-10735.diff

On Windows, we don't build Python from sources. Therefore, only patches to
Python code can be applied. Patches to C code cannot be applied on Windows,
where we use the already-compiled upstream Python package.

To have a Python-only patch automatically applied on Windows, save it as
a ".diff" file in this sub-dir, e.g. "CVE-2015-20107.diff". If it doesn't apply
cleanly, try adapting it to our sources.

The ".diff" patches are copied over automatically before building Python,
alongside the original "*.patch" fixes. The `chevahbs` script in this sub-dir
is going to patch the ".diff" patches on Windows, ordered by filename.
