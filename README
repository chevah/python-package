Python Portable Package
=======================

This code is here to generate a portable Python distribution,

It is used by our Buildbot script to generate and publish binary python
distribution.

Here are the steps used by Buildbot:

* Login on the new platform
* Get code from git
* ./chevah_build build
* ./chevah_build test
* upload to binary dist publishing website.


Rebuild Python from your home
---------------------------

If a buildbot is already active for the platform, you can use
`paver test_remote` to rebuild Python distribution on that system,

You will have to wait about 10 minutes after publishing so that the packages
will reach the public server.

Do a testing build (files go in http://binary.chevah.com/testing/python/)::

    paver test_remote NAME_OF_BUILDER

Do a production build
(files go in http://binary.chevah.com/production/python/)::

    paver test_remote NAME_OF_BUILDER --force-upload-production
