/* As long as this function is defined in a translation unit all by
   itself, and we aren't doing LTO, it would be enough for it to just
   call memset.  While compiling _this_ translation unit, the compiler
   has no information about what the callers do with the buffer, so it
   cannot eliminate the memset.  While compiling code that _calls_
   this function, the compiler doesn't know what it does, so it cannot
   eliminate the call (if it has special knowledge of a function with
   this name, we would hope that it knows _not_ to optimize it out!)

   However, in anticipation of doing LTO on this library one day, we
   add two more defensive measures, when we know how: the function is
   marked no-inline, and there is a no-op assembly insert immediately
   after the memset call, declared to read the memory that the memset
   writes.  */
