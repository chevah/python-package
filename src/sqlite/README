This sub-directory holds SQLite, as downloaded from upstream and unpacked.

For example, for version 3.23.0:

 * sources from https://sqlite.org/2018/sqlite-autoconf-3230000.tar.gz
 * 32bit DLL from https://sqlite.org/2018/sqlite-dll-win32-x86-3230000.zip

SQLite code is built by the pysqlite module, thus there's no "chevahbs" script.

The 32bit binary file is used to update the SQLite DLL bundled with upstream
Python installer on Windows.
