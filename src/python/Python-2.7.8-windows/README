We don't build the Python from source, yet but we do compile some modules.

The system on which Python distribution is created needs to have:
* Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582
* Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 installed
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266

Get Visual C++ nonSxS redistributables and copy them in the `redistributables'
folder.

Get MSI installer from official Python website and copy + rename it here.

For pip get latest get-pip.py in copy it in /python-modules/get-pip.py

Make sure you have sources and wheels on the private PyPi server.

Get the manifest-wiper from here:
https://bitbucket.org/alibotean/sxs-manifest-wiper

Please note that VC compiler is used by default by pip. To manually enable
it, make sure you have latest setuptools:

1. Enter MSVC for Python command prompt
2. SET DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1
3. SET MSSdk=1
4. python.exe setup.py build
