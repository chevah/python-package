We don't build the Python from source, yet but we do compile some modules.

The system on which Python distribution is created needs to have the
Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 installed
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266


Get Visual C++ nonsxs redistributables and copy them in the `redistributables'
folder.

Get MSI installer from official Python website and copy + rename it here.

For setuptools get latest ez_setup.py but also copy the setuptools-VER.zip
from PyPi to avoid touching the network and making sure it will work in the
future.

For pip get latest get-pip.py

Make sure you have sources and wheels on the private PyPi server
