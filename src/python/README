As Python 2.7 is no longer maintained upstream, security patches are lifted from
ActiveState's fork: https://github.com/ActiveState/cpython/commits/2.7.

E.g. to fix CVE-2020-10735 from https://github.com/ActiveState/cpython/pull/18,
https://github.com/ActiveState/cpython/pull/18.diff is saved to this sub-dir as
CVE-2020-10735.diff.

To apply the new patch to our Python sources tree, issue something like:

    cd Python-2.7.18
    patch -p1 <../CVE-2020-10735.diff

On Windows, we don't build Python from sources. Therefore, the *.diff hot fixes
are copied over automatically before building Python, alongside the original
*.patch fixes. The `chevahbs` script in this sub-dir is going to patch them
on top of the *.patch diffs.
