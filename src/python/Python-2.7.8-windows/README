We don't build the Python from source yet.

* Get MSI installer from official Python website and copy+rename it here.
* For setuptools get latest ez_setup.py but also copy the setuptools-VER.zip
  from PyPi to avoid touching the network and making sure it will work in the
  future.
* For pip get latest get-pip.py.
* Make sure you have soures and wheels on the private PyPi server.
